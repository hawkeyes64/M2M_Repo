Rough guide for using this repo:

Please visit http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ and download PyCharm (Used as the python IDE)
Make sure you have python (Version 2.7 preferably) installed.

You will also need the latest ADT available here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Set the ADT workspace to the root repository folder in order to work on the android app.

If deploying to cloud server app, please read the comments in fabfile.py - you will need to private key
and some software utilities installed to connect and deploy. ====> You need the fabric python module
locally too!!! (I had to download the pycrypto binary first)
